<span>
  <!-- main children -->
  <ng-content />
</span>
@if (icon()) {
  <span class="icon">{{ icon() }}</span>
}
<!-- selects 2nd set of children, identified with 'class="icon"' -->
<!-- <ng-content select=".icon"></ng-content> -->
<!-- this approach isn't attractive, its just better to use input and define HTML within -->

<!--
  <span class="icon">
    <ng-content select="icon">
      // allows fallback if no span with icon is projected
    </ng-content>
  </span>
-->
<!-- this allows parent to use
  <button custom>
    content
    <span ngProjectAs="icon"> â†’ </span>
  </button>
and define any selector without . or #
however this creates a span in a span, just only the top span has .icon class -->
